The layout of the main macLLM window is as follows.

The window is borderless and doesn't have the normal bar with icons at the top.

We have three main areas on top of each other
- The top bar with logo
- The main conversation area
- The entry box at the bottom

Window height is 90% of the screen height (calculated from the screen height)
Total width should allow for 80 characters in the main conversation box.
Padding for all parts by default is 8 pixels

The vertical stack is:

1. The Top Bar
Height: 64 pixels (plus padding)
Three horizonal sections
- The macLLM icon in assets/icon64x64 flush left
- Next to it a status area. Right now only shows the LLM in use
- Flush right a gear icon to configure preferences

2. Padding

3. Main Conversation area
Below the top bar. Large text box that shows conversation history.
Expands to show the entire conversation if possible. Maximum height
is limited by the fixed size of the top and bottom bar and the 
fixed width of the overall macLLM window.

4. Padding

5.  Bottom entry bar
Entry box that has the focus and allows the user to enter prompts. 
Scrollable, 5 lines of text visible.
